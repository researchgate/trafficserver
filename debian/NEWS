trafficserver (6.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * If you are using 32-bits package, please not that upstream has
    discontinued 32-bit support.
    32-bits Debian package will still be built, but is subject to removal
    whenever 32-bit fails.

trafficserver (3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If you are upgrading from v2.1.8 or earlier to ATS 3.0 you need to migrate
    to the new `records.config' configuration file. If possible, let Debian
    overwrite your `records.config' configuration file.
  * Moreover you should clear all caches after upgrading (e.g. do "traffic_server
    -Cclear").
  * The host.db data abse isn't required anymore. Therefore you can delete
    `/etc/trafficserver/internal/hostdb.config' and `/var/cache/trafficserver/
    host.db'.

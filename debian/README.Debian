trafficserver for Debian
------------------------

* If you are using 32-bits package, please note that upstream has
    discontinued 32-bit support.
    32-bits Debian package will still be built, but is subject to removal
    whenever 32-bit fails.

* Please read the CONFIGURATION.Debian file to get started with Traffic Server.

* Currently Apache Traffic Server lacks man pages of binaries shipped along the
  package. That's a known problem which is being worked on. Please read the
  upstream documentation on the website instead.

* If you read upstream's documentation about Traffic Server you will sometimes
  find references to a program `/usr/bin/trafficserver`. Debian does not ship
  this script. This is intentional. Use Debian's /etc/init.d/trafficserver
  script instead.
